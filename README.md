This is my first responsive website that I have developed using: \
⚡️ ReactJS, EmailJS and more. ⚡️ \
The purpose of this website was to serve as an easy and simple way to contact me at the beginning of my job search process. \
On this website you can: 
👍 Read a bit about me and my skills. \
👍 Download My resume. \
👍 Contact me via mail, linkedin and phone. \
👍 Get all the information you need in English and Hebrew.
